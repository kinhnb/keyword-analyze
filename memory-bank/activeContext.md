## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Redis Caching Strategy**
   - Implemented separate key prefixes for different cache types (SERP, analysis, recommendations)
   - Used a default 24-hour TTL with customization options
   - Created a unified invalidation mechanism for all cache types
   - Used Redis connection pooling for performance and reliability
   - Implemented proper serialization/deserialization with error handling
   - Added connection management with graceful failure handling

2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**
   - Implemented a BaseAgent abstract class to ensure consistent interface
   - Used composition over inheritance for specialized agent implementation
   - Created clear handoff mechanisms between agents
   - Registered appropriate tools for each agent's specialization

3. **Agent Instructions**
   - Created detailed, step-by-step instructions for each agent
   - Used natural language processing to guide the agents
   - Included niche-specific guidance for POD graphic tees
   - Added important considerations and signals to watch for

4. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling in the BaseAgent run method
   - Added timeout configuration to prevent long-running operations
   - Created proper error messages for debugging
   - Used try/except blocks with specific exception handling

5. **Agent Testing Strategy**
   - Created unit tests for individual agent components
   - Implemented integration tests for agent collaboration
   - Used proper mocking for external dependencies
   - Tested error handling and edge cases

### Challenges and Risks

1. **Agent Interaction Complexity**
   - Handoffs between agents add complexity and potential points of failure
   - Ensuring consistent data format between agents is critical
   - Error handling across agent boundaries requires careful consideration
   - Testing collaborative workflows is more complex than single-agent testing

2. **Tool Error Handling**
   - Tool failures could impact agent performance
   - Fallback mechanisms might produce lower quality results
   - Need to implement proper tracing for debugging
   - Consider more sophisticated retry strategies

3. **Instruction Tuning**
   - Agent instructions require tuning for optimal performance
   - Balance between detail and brevity in instructions
   - Need to test instructions with various input types
   - Consider instruction optimization based on performance testing

### Open Questions

1. How should we handle SERP API credentials in production?
2. Should we implement a rate limiter for the SERP API calls?
3. How can we improve the quality of recommendations from gap detection?
4. Should we expand keyword analysis to use more advanced NLP techniques?
5. What's the optimal caching strategy to balance freshness and cost?
6. How should we handle mixed-intent search terms in the agent system?
7. What metrics should we collect to evaluate agent performance?
