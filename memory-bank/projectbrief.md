# Project Brief: AI SERP Keyword Research Agent for POD Graphic Tees

## Core Requirements

This project aims to build an intelligent system using the OpenAI Agents SDK framework that analyzes Google Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) for search terms related to Print-on-Demand graphic tees. The system will extract key SEO insights and recommend targeted optimization strategies.

## Goals

1. **SERP Analysis**: Analyze search engine results to extract valuable SEO insights for POD graphic tees.
2. **Intent Detection**: Identify search intent (transactional, informational, exploratory, navigational) from SERP data.
3. **Keyword Optimization**: Extract primary and secondary keywords for optimization.
4. **Market Gap Identification**: Detect unaddressed needs or opportunities in search results.
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Generate specific, actionable SEO recommendations.
6. **Seamless Integration**: Provide API endpoints for integration with existing workflows and platforms.

## Project Scope

The system will:
- Focus specifically on the Print-on-Demand graphic tees niche
- Leverage multi-agent orchestration with three specialized agents:
  - SEO Expert Agent (Orchestrator)
  - Intent Analyzer Agent
  - Recommendation Agent
- Implement tool-based capabilities for SERP data retrieval and analysis
- Process search terms through a six-stage pipeline:
  1. Input Validation Stage
  2. SERP Retrieval Stage
  3. Intent Analysis Stage
  4. Market Gap Analysis Stage
  5. Recommendation Generation Stage
  6. Output Formatting Stage
- Classify search intent using four distinct strategies:
  - Transactional Intent Strategy
  - Informational Intent Strategy
  - Exploratory Intent Strategy
  - Navigational Intent Strategy
- Follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Include comprehensive input/output guardrails for safe operation
- Provide tracing and monitoring capabilities
- Deliver results through RESTful API endpoints

## Success Criteria

1. Accurate identification of search intent (>90% accuracy)
2. Relevant keyword extraction and prioritization
3. Actionable optimization recommendations with confidence scores
4. Seamless integration with existing systems via API
5. Reliable performance with proper error handling and retries
6. Comprehensive tracing for debugging and monitoring
7. Response time under 30 seconds for 95% of requests
8. 99.9% API availability

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:
1. **Foundation Phase**: Project setup, data layer, domain models
2. **Core Processing Phase**: Pipeline implementation, intent classification
3. **Agent Capabilities Phase**: Function tools, agent implementation, output models
4. **API & Infrastructure Phase**: API endpoints, observability, security, deployment
5. **Documentation & Testing Phase**: Documentation, testing, maintenance procedures

## Technical Stack

- OpenAI Agents SDK for agent orchestration and tools
- Python 3.10+ as primary programming language
- FastAPI for RESTful API endpoints
- PostgreSQL for production data storage (SQLite for development)
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for production deployment

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this project:
- Full-stack web UI development (API-only)
- Bulk keyword research capabilities (focused on single-term analysis)
- Competitive research beyond SERP analysis
- E-commerce platform integration (third-party responsibility)
- PPC bid management
- Content creation beyond recommendations
