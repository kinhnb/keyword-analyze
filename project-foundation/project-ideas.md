## 1. Project Name
AI SERP Keyword Research Agent for POD Graphic Tees

## 2. Project Objectives
- Build an AI agent that analyzes Google SERPs for SEO keyword research in the Print on Demand (POD) niche, focusing on graphic tees.
- Extract main/secondary keywords, identify intent, and detect market gaps based on SERP analysis.
- Recommend SEO tactics tailored to the intent and structure of top-ranking SERP URLs.

## 3. Problem Statement
- Manual keyword research for POD products is time-consuming and often misses intent or market gaps.
- Existing tools rarely analyze SERP similarity, intent, and market opportunities in a way that is specific to product type and customer theme.

## 4. Main User Groups
- SEO specialists and marketers for POD stores (especially graphic tees)
- Store owners and product managers in e-commerce
- Content strategists targeting niche apparel markets

## 5. Core Features
- Input: Search term seed (e.g., "Best dad ever shirt")
- SERP analysis via external API (analyzes top 10 SERPs, with higher weighting/prioritization for the top 3 results)
- Extraction of main/secondary keywords
- **Advanced intent analysis:** The agent should distinguish between transactional, informational, and navigational intent, and especially recognize when transactional intent dominates (suggesting product page SEO) versus exploratory/idea-seeking intent (suggesting collection/category SEO).
- **SERP features analysis:** The agent should recognize SERP features (e.g., People Also Ask, Shopping Ads, Featured Snippets) to inform tactical recommendations (e.g., if Shopping Ads are prevalent, paid competition is high; if Featured Snippets are common, optimize for Q&A content).
- Intent detection (theme + product type)
- Market gap detection (when SERPs lack matching intent)
- SEO tactic recommendation (transactional vs. exploratory intent)
- Pydantic validation for all inputs/outputs
- Logging and tracing for debugging and optimization

## 6. Project Scope
**Included:**
- Agent logic for SERP analysis, keyword extraction, intent detection, and tactic recommendation
- Integration with SERP API (with retry/backoff)
- Guardrails for input/output validation
- Unit tests (happy path & edge cases)
- Documentation and usage examples
**Out of Scope:**
- Full-stack web UI (CLI or API only)
- Bulk keyword research (single query per run)

## 7. Technologies & Frameworks
- OpenAI Agents SDK (Python)
- Pydantic for validation
- Requests for API calls
- Pytest for testing
- Logging module for traceability

## 8. Special Technical Requirements
- API keys must be stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- All external API calls must use retry/backoff logic
- Input/output validation with clear error messages

## 9. Expected Deliverables
- Source code (agent, tool, schemas)
- Unit tests
- Documentation (framework-guide.md, implementation-guide.md, usage example)

## 10. Success Criteria
- Accurate extraction of main/secondary keywords and intent from SERPs
- Reliable detection of market gaps
- Actionable SEO tactic recommendations
- All tests pass in CI

## 11. Risks & Challenges
- SERP API rate limits or instability
- Ambiguous or insufficient SERP data for some queries
- Evolving SERP structures may require ongoing maintenance

## 12. Main Contacts/Stakeholders
- Project owner: [Your Name]
- Stakeholders: SEO team, e-commerce managers

## 13. Estimated Start/End Dates
- Start: April 2025
- End: May 2025

## 14. Function Tools
- SERP API Tool: Calls an external API to fetch SERP results for a given search term. Includes retry/backoff logic and Pydantic input/output validation.
- Keyword Analysis Module: Extracts main/secondary keywords, intent, and market gaps from SERP results.

## 15. API Endpoints
- `/analyze-keyword` (POST): Accepts a search term, returns keyword analysis, intent, market gap, and SEO tactic recommendation.
- `/health` (GET): Health check endpoint for monitoring.

## Output
- **Main keyword:** The primary keyword identified from SERP analysis.
- **Secondary keywords:** Related/supporting keywords extracted from the SERPs.
- **SEO tactic:** Recommended page type for targeting (e.g., product page or collection page) based on SERP intent and URL structure.

## 16. Data Sources
- Google SERPs via SERP API (e.g., SerpAPI)
- User-provided search terms (seed keywords)
- Optionally: Internal keyword lists for validation or enrichment
- **SERP snapshots:** If possible, store SERP snapshots for later analysis and to monitor SERP volatility or audit strategy changes.
- **Keyword difficulty/volume data:** If available, integrate keyword difficulty and search volume metrics (from Ahrefs, SEMrush, or free APIs) to enrich analysis and prioritize opportunities.

## 17. Integration
- Integrates with SERP API for search data
- Can be embedded in a web app, CLI, or as an API service
- Optional: Integration with Slack, Zapier, or other workflow automation tools for notifications or keyword research workflows

## 18. Prompt/Instruction
- System prompt: "You are an SEO expert specializing in Print on Demand (POD) stores for graphic tees. Analyze SERPs for a given search term, extract main/secondary keywords, detect market gaps, and recommend SEO tactics based on intent."
- Behavioral rules: Always validate input, prioritize ranking/intent, flag market gaps, and provide actionable recommendations.
- Example input: "Best dad ever shirt"

## 19. Metrics
- SERP analysis success rate
- Response time (API latency)
- Accuracy of intent/keyword extraction (manual review or user feedback)
- **Intent detection accuracy:** Track how often the agent's intent classification matches expert/ground truth assessments.
- **Tactic recommendation relevance:** Measure the appropriateness of tactic suggestions for each SERP type via expert/user feedback.
- User satisfaction (feedback forms, NPS)
- Error rate (failed API calls, invalid inputs)

## 20. Environment & Deployment
- Deployable locally (dev) or on cloud/container platforms (e.g., Docker, AWS EC2, GCP)
- CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- Versioning: Semantic versioning for releases
- Logging: Centralized logging for traceability
- Monitoring: Health checks and error alerts

## 21. Security & Privacy
- API keys stored in environment variables (never hardcoded)
- Access control for API endpoints (API keys or OAuth if public)
- No storage of sensitive user data; logs anonymized
- Compliance with GDPR and data protection best practices

## 22. User Interaction & Feedback
- Feedback endpoint or UI form for user comments
- Conversation/session logging for improvement
- **Quick feedback mechanism:** Allow users to rate or comment on each analysis/tactic suggestion (e.g., "Was this tactic relevant?") for rapid iteration.
- **Edge-case logging:** Log cases where the agent cannot determine intent or tactic, to prioritize future improvements.
- Regular review of feedback and logs to iterate on agent performance

## 23. Error Handling & Recovery
- Input/output validation with clear error messages
- Retry/backoff logic for external API failures
- Logging of all errors and exceptions
- Fallback responses for critical failures (e.g., "Unable to analyze at this time")

## 24. Testing & Evaluation
- Unit tests for all modules (pytest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests simulating user flows
- Evaluation criteria: All tests pass, high accuracy in manual reviews, stable performance under load

## 25. Customization & Extensibility
- Modular architecture: Add new tools (e.g., additional APIs) with minimal changes
- Configurable system prompt and behavioral rules
- Support for plugin-based extensions or dynamic tool loading
- **Custom intent and SERP pattern support:** Allow users to define custom intent categories or SERP patterns for niche/market-specific research.

## 26. Compliance & Ethics
- Adherence to OpenAI use-case policies and AI ethics
- No scraping or use of prohibited data sources
- Transparent about data usage and limitations
- Mechanisms to avoid bias and ensure fair recommendations

> The above answers provide a robust foundation for building, deploying, and maintaining the AI SERP Keyword Research Agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
